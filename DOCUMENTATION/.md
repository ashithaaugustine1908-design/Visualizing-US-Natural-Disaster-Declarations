## 📘 Learning Journey as a Beginner
As a beginner in data analytics, this project represents my first structured hands-on experience with data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Working with tools like Power BI, Power Query, Python, APIs, and live data sources was initially challenging, especially when handling raw FEMA data, managing missing values, and correcting data types.

Over four weeks, I progressed through each stage of the data analytics lifecycle—from basic data cleaning to exploratory data analysis and finally working with APIs and data pipelines. This documentation captures both what I learned and how my confidence grew while applying industry-relevant tools to a real-world dataset.

## 1️⃣Replaced Value (Text Standardization)
### Action:
* Removed unwanted characters such as underscores (_), hyphens (-), and inconsistent spacing.
* Replace null values and empty spaces with Unknown
### Purpose:
Improves clarity and consistency in categorical and descriptive columns.
## 2️⃣ Filtered Rows (Data Quality Control)
### Action:
* Removed rows containing null, blank, or invalid values.
* Excluded records that could not contribute meaningful insights.
### Purpose:
Ensures accuracy and relevance of the dataset.
### 3️⃣ Changed Type (Initial Data Type Conversion)
Columns converted:
event_date → Date, 
event_time → Time, 
event_id → Whole Number, 
fatality_count, injury_count → Whole Number
latitude, longitude → Decimal Number

Purpose:

Enables correct calculations, sorting, and filtering in Power BI.

4️⃣ Replaced Value (Multiple Cleaning Iterations)

Columns affected:

trigger

landslide_setting

country_name

admin_division

Action:

Standardized naming conventions (e.g., rainfall-related triggers).

Removed ambiguous or inconsistent entries.

Purpose:

Ensures uniform categorization for reliable analysis.

5️⃣ Removed Columns (Irrelevant Data Elimination)

Columns removed included:

Redundant metadata fields

Empty or sparsely populated columns

Columns not required for visualization or KPIs

Purpose:

Reduces clutter and improves dataset performance.

6️⃣ Renamed and Refined Columns

Examples:

Cleaned column headers for better readability.

Standardized naming format (lowercase, underscores).

Purpose:

Makes the dataset intuitive and easier to use in dashboards.

7️⃣ Changed Type (Final Validation)

Columns revalidated:

event_date

event_time

fatality_count

injury_count

Action:

Rechecked and corrected data types after transformations.

Purpose:

Guarantees data integrity before loading into the model.

8️⃣ Final Replace Value (Advanced Text Cleaning)

Column affected:

landslide_setting

Action:

Final cleanup to remove remaining symbols and formatting issues.

Purpose:

Ensures clean categorical values for filtering and segmentation.

🧹 Data Cleaning – Step-by-Step Process (Power Query)

This section explains how the Global Landslide Catalog dataset was cleaned, starting from raw data import to the final analysis-ready dataset using Power Query in Power BI.

🔹 Step 1: Load Raw Data

Imported the raw dataset into Power Query Editor.

Source contained unstructured text, inconsistent formatting, and irrelevant fields.

🔹 Step 2: Review Column Structure

Identified key analytical columns:

event_id

event_date

event_time

event_title

event_description

source_name

source_link

country_name

admin_division

location_description

landslide_setting

trigger

fatality_count

injury_count

latitude

longitude

🔹 Step 3: Remove Unnecessary Columns

Action:

Deleted columns that were:

Empty

Duplicates

Not relevant to analysis

Result:

Dataset reduced to 25 meaningful columns, improving performance and clarity.

🔹 Step 4: Filter Invalid and Blank Records

Columns checked:

event_date

country_name

landslide_setting

Action:

Removed rows with null, blank, or invalid values.

Purpose:

Ensures reliability and accuracy of insights.

🔹 Step 5: Clean Text Values (Replace Values)

Columns cleaned:

landslide_setting

event_title

event_description

trigger

country_name

Actions performed:

Removed underscores (_), hyphens (-), and extra spaces

Standardized inconsistent naming patterns

Improved text readability

🔹 Step 6: Standardize Categorical Data

Columns standardized:

landslide_setting

trigger

admin_division

Action:

Unified similar values under common names (e.g., rainfall-related triggers).

Purpose:

Enables accurate grouping and filtering in reports.

🔹 Step 7: Change Data Types

Conversions applied:

event_id → Whole Number

event_date → Date

event_time → Time

fatality_count, injury_count → Whole Number

latitude, longitude → Decimal Number

Purpose:

Prevents calculation and visualization errors.

🔹 Step 8: Rename Columns for Consistency

Actions:

Renamed columns to follow a standard naming convention:

Lowercase letters

Underscore-separated words

Example:

Improved readability and usability across Power BI visuals.

🔹 Step 9: Final Text Validation

Column validated:

landslide_setting

Action:

Final replace-value cleanup to remove any remaining formatting issues.
